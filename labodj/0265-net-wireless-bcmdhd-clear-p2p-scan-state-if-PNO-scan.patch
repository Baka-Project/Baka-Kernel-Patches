Subject: [PATCH 265/590] net: wireless: bcmdhd:  clear p2p scan state if PNO
 scan will start

	Problem : if PNO scan occurs in Driver after p2p scan,
		  we failed to do PNO scan
	Root cause : In the wl_run_escan function, we still goes into
	p2p scan code even though current scan is PNO which is kind of
	legacy scan.

	Solution : we need to clear the staus of P2P scan before doing
	PNO SCAN.
	Bug : 11190960
