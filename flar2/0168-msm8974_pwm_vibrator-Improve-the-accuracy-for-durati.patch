Subject: [PATCH 168/276] msm8974_pwm_vibrator: Improve the accuracy for
 duration

When you press 2 more touches simultaneously, vibration would be weak.
This is the reason why the driving state is not gauranteed.
If the vibrator is already in the driving state. just keep going
for the driving force.
