Subject: [PATCH 107/276] cpufreq: Manage only online cpus

cpufreq core doesn't manage offline cpus and if driver->init() has returned
mask including offline cpus, it may result in unwanted behavior by cpufreq core
or governors.

We need to get only online cpus in this mask. There are two places to fix this
mask, cpufreq core and cpufreq driver. It makes sense to do this at common place
and hence is done in core.
